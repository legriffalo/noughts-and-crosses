# 👋 Hi, here's a simple stopwatch App

## 📝 Project Description

### What is Noughts and crosses?
I built this from a VERY old project I made when I was starting out with web coding as a way to test the capacitor framework using the most minimal file/tool set I could.

App uses a single file with bootstrap 4 (CDN), JS, and JQuery(CDN) to make a stopwatch then this is transpiled to Java for the final build using capacitor.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🎯 Feature 1: Native code transpiled through Capacitor
- 🔄 Feature 2: functional

### 🎯 Why Use this project?
- I wouldn't 😂
- It's a good "simplest case possible" example to pick apart to learn capacitor.js
